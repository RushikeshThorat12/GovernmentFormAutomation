1. Document Ingestion
Source formats: PDF, DOCX, HTML, etc.

Loaders: Libraries like PyPDF2 or PyMuPDF extract raw text from each document.

Output: A pool of plain text passages ready for processing.

2. Text Chunking & Context Windowing
Chunking: Split long documents into smaller “chunks” (e.g. 500–1,000 tokens) so each fits within the LLM’s context window.

Overlap: Typically include a small overlap (e.g. 50 tokens) between adjacent chunks to preserve continuity.

Result: An indexed list of text chunks, each tagged with its source metadata (document ID, page numbers, etc.).

3. Embedding Generation
Chunk Embeddings (“Normic embeddings” in your setup):

Each text chunk is passed through an embedding model (e.g. OpenAI’s embeddings API or a “normic” in‑house model).

Produces a fixed‑length vector for each chunk.

Storage: All chunk vectors go into a five‑factor vector database (e.g. Pinecone, Weaviate, or custom store), indexed for fast similarity search.

4. Query Processing
User question: When a user asks something, the question is first pre‑processed (lowercased, cleaned) just like the documents.

Question embedding: The cleaned question is embedded by the same model used for chunks, yielding a “query vector.”

5. Similarity Search & Retrieval
Cosine similarity search: The query vector is compared against all chunk vectors in the vector database.

Top‑k retrieval: The k most similar chunks (e.g. k=5 or 10) are pulled out as the retrieval set.

Five‑factor DB: If you have additional metadata factors (e.g. recency, source trust, domain specificity), you can re‑rank the retrieved chunks here before final selection.

6. LLM Context Assembly
Context window: Concatenate the top‑k retrieved chunks (in rank order) into a single prompt, along with instructions about how the LLM should use them.

Prompt template:

You are a knowledgeable assistant.  
Use the following document excerpts to answer the question.  
-------------------  
[Chunk #1 text]  
[Chunk #2 text]

Question: “<user’s question>”

7. Response Generation
LLM call: Send the assembled prompt to the language model.

Retrieval‑Augmented Answer: The model generates a response that cites or leverages the retrieved chunks directly.

Post‑processing (optional): You can run simple checks—like length limits or safety filters—before returning the final answer to the user.
